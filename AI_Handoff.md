## What this is

A single-node NAS appliance on Talos Linux (Kubernetes) with a web UI.

## Production instance (2026-11-08)

- **Hardware:** the production NAS is the bare-metal node `talos-zgr-9yg` at
  `192.168.1.38` (Talos v1.14.5, Kubernetes v1.37.0, control-plane Ready). The
  old `192.168.1.117` VM is powered off. The recovery bundle imported into
  `bootstrap/vm/` points at `.38`; the `vm` names (`bootstrap/vm/*`,
  `values-vm.yaml`, `install-vm`, `deploy-vm.sh`) are historical paths for the
  single node, not a VM.
- **Deployed release:** Helm `naslos` chart `0.3.9`, appVersion `0.3.9`,
  revision 5, deployed 2026-11-08 17:13 UTC (web-UI upgrade from 0.3.7). Images
  are digest-pinned from the 0.3.9 pack: API `f997d266…`, agent `a07b2ae4…`, UI
  `ed0b0b5d…`, OpenLDAP `1fdf1114…`, Samba `b9dfed58…`, NFS `1a7ee8ec…`,
  terminal `f1f56d15…`. `/api/system/version` reports chart/naslos `0.3.9`,
  profile `installer`, Talos v1.14.5, k8s v1.37.0.
- **Latest release:** `v0.3.9` (2026-11-08) is deployed; installer
  `naslos-v0.3.9` is published. `v0.3.8` was superseded by it.
- **Release notes since 0.3.7:**
  - `0.3.9` (deployed) — per-app Internet access (default on) with a per-app
    `<app>-internet` NetworkPolicy; opt-out is enforced for isolated baseline
    apps. Plan: `.kilo/plans/2026-11-08-app-internet-access.md`.
  - `0.3.8` (superseded) — pool-backed app storage, `zd*` disk filtering, agent
    share-folder view, `naslos_users` supplemental group.
- **Storage:** `Data` (10.9T, `sdc` + `sdb` cache) is ONLINE with datasets under
  `/var/mnt/Data` (normalized from the old TrueNAS `/Data` tree); `ssd-storage`
  (238G, `nvme0n1`) hosts app data. Ownership is `admin:naslos_users`
  (10001:10000), directories setgid. The `naslos-pool-ssd-storage-*`
  provisioner/StorageClass remains from the storage-pool drill.
- **Apps/domains:** no app is currently installed (`apps.json` is empty); the
  SearXNG test install in `naslos-app-1` was removed after the upgrade. The
  `shail.ovh` domain (OVH, production, `sso: true`) and the
  `naslos-shail-ovh-tls` wildcard secret remain in `naslos-app-1`.
- **Update check:** current `0.3.9`; no newer release.

### Open items

- **Reinstall SearXNG** (or another app) if needed; the install form's
  "Internet access" toggle defaults on, so the app gets `<app>-internet`.
- **SMB account-case fix** merged to `master` in PR #123 (canonical lowercase
  keys, load-time merge, group-by-name rendering, startup apply); it is not yet
  in a release image. The live passdb was remediated manually on 2026-11-08.
- **External access to `shail.ovh`** relies on the OVH router forwarding 80/443
  to `192.168.1.38`. Verify the forward target (the node's LAN IP changed from
  the old `.117`) and use a static DHCP lease; NAT loopback is needed for LAN
  clients using the public name.
- **Playwright** has not been rerun since the bare-metal switch.

## How to operate

```bash
# Gates (run inside the repo; there is no make test/lint)
cd rust && cargo fmt --all -- --check
cd rust && cargo clippy -p naslos-api --all-targets -- -D warnings
cd rust && cargo test -p naslos-api
cd rust && cargo test -p naslos-agent
cd ui   && npm run check && npm run build
helm lint charts/naslos -f charts/naslos/values.yaml -f charts/naslos/values-vm.yaml
helm lint charts/naslos -f charts/naslos/values.yaml -f charts/naslos/values-installer.yaml
sh scripts/audit.sh
```

- **Deploy:** `make install-vm` is the historical target name for the single
  node. It renders `-f values.yaml -f values-vm.yaml` (not `--reuse-values`),
  installs `crds`, `cert-manager` and the OVH webhook first, and targets the
  current kubeconfig (`bootstrap/vm/kubeconfig`, endpoint `192.168.1.38`).
  Always bump image tags; the registry reuses tags and the chart pulls with
  `IfNotPresent`.
- **Verify:** `kubectl -n naslos rollout status deploy/naslos-api` and
  `curl -sk https://naslos.local/api/health` (`naslos.local` resolves to
  `192.168.1.38`).
- **Cluster access:** `export KUBECONFIG=bootstrap/vm/kubeconfig` and
  `export TALOSCONFIG=bootstrap/vm/talosconfig` (the files point at `.38`).
- **API access:** the API is owner-gated and restricted to the proxy/pod CIDR.
  Query it from a trusted pod (e.g.
  `kubectl -n naslos-privileged exec deploy/naslos-terminal`) with
  `Remote-User`, `Remote-Groups` and `X-Naslos-Proxy-Secret`, not from the
  workstation.

## Operational gotchas (hard-won — read before drilling)

1. **Always bump image tag suffixes.** The registry reuses tags and the chart
   pulls with `IfNotPresent`, so a retag alone can keep running old code
   (NAS-022). Digests are supported (`api.image.digest`, `make image-digests`);
   a stored digest wins over a new tag until you clear it
   (`--set api.image.digest=`).
2. **`helm upgrade --reuse-values` ignores `-f` files.** Anything new must be
   passed with `--set` (e.g. `ingress.enabled`), or the release keeps old values
   and templates that dereference new keys can fail to render.
3. **There is one posture and it is authenticated.** Traefik on hostPort 80/443
   with Authelia forwardAuth; no NodePort and no auth bypass exist. `make
   install-vm` installs it; there is no unauthenticated listener to fall back to
   (NAS-008 resolved).
4. **The buddy identity is the KEK.** `/var/lib/naslos/buddy-identity.json` holds
   the private key and the key-encryption key: losing it makes every stored
   backup unreadable, and `helm uninstall` would delete it (CR-02). Back it up
   separately.
5. **Platform mount-propagation trap.** A dataset created from inside a pod is
   mounted in that pod's namespace only; in the host namespace its mountpoint is
   a plain directory on the parent. `zfs send` of such a dataset captures
   nothing — the API refuses it (`requireMountedDataset`), and the agent's
   `UsedBytes`-based guard also refuses a published stream that is a small
   fraction of the dataset's used space. The fix is a node reboot (or `zfs mount
   <dataset>` on the host). Shares have the same trap for newly created
   datasets.
6. **The receive dataset's ownership is fixed by the
   `fix-receive-dataset-ownership` init container** (uid 65532). Manual
   fallback: `chown 65532:65532 /var/mnt/<pool>/naslos-buddy`.
7. **Store-root dot files matter:** `.enroll-used` records a spent enrollment
   token (delete it to re-arm the token), `.nonces` is the persisted replay
   cache. Both are dot-prefixed so quota accounting ignores them; wiping `k*`
   directories clears the stored backups.
8. **Quotas are per key and count *sealed* bytes**, and `MinPeerQuota` is one
   sealed chunk (`MaxSealedChunkSize`), not one plain chunk.
9. **The Playwright suite runs against the live node and can skip** when the
   identity, a dataset or a peer scope is missing: treat a skip as a setup gap,
   not a pass (CR-23). It authenticates through Authelia (credentials in the
   gitignored `ui/.env.playwright.local`) and runs against
   `https://naslos.local`.
10. **A dataset once mounted in a pod namespace can answer `dataset is busy`.**
    `zfs receive` runs through the privileged agent, so the destination stays
    mounted in the **agent's** mount namespace (the terminal pod's namespace
    does not see that mount). `DestroyDataset` now recovers on its own: on a
    busy failure it forces `zfs unmount -f`, then clears
    `mountpoint=none,canmount=off` and retries. Only a residual leaked-kernel
    reference (no mounts, no holds, no snapshots) still needs a pool
    export/import, which the agent deliberately does not do; the error names
    that state. `kubectl -n naslos-privileged rollout restart ds/naslos-agent`
    remains a manual fallback.
11. **PSA is enforced per namespace.** `naslos` and `naslos-privileged` are
    `privileged`; the shared `naslos-apps` is **`baseline`** and
    `naslos-apps-priv` is `privileged`; the per-app pools `naslos-app-1..8` are
    `baseline` and `naslos-app-p1..4` are `privileged`. Baseline **forbids
    `hostPath` volumes**, so managed app charts mount the platform's
    `naslos-datasets` RWX PVC; `hostPath` and `NET_ADMIN` only work in the
    privileged namespaces (a chart opts in with `privileged: true`).
12. **The node has Internet; platform pods do not, by default.**
    `naslos-workload-egress` is default-deny, so the API cannot clone a chart
    repo until `networkPolicy.gitEgress: true` (on in the node overlay; ports
    443/22/9418). Image pulls are kubelet traffic and unaffected by pod policy.
    **Apps are the exception:** per-app exposure defaults `internet: true` and
    the API applies `<app>-internet` in the app namespace (0.3.9+). Turning
    "Internet access" off is enforced only for a baseline app in its own
    isolated namespace; privileged and legacy shared namespaces always allow
    Internet and reject the opt-out.
13. **Channels are a source property, and authoritative.** A source that
    declares channels uses exactly those (no defaults merge). NaslosCharts has
    only `main`, so the node overlay sets `apps.officialSource.channels: {Prod:
    main}`; a channel pointing at a missing branch reports a per-source error.
14. **`make install-vm` renders the `-f` files; it is not `--reuse-values`.**
    New keys in `values*.yaml` apply, but the official source is seeded only
    when it is absent from `sources.json` — to change its URL/channels/auth,
    delete it (`DELETE /api/sources/naslos`) and restart the API so it re-seeds
    from env.
